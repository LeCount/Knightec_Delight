Terminology


"Master": Source code, that is considered to be the final version of the project. 
          The Master can not be rolled back to a previous state.
        
"Branch": Source code, that is not considered to be the final version (code under development). 
          A branch does not effect the Master until it is "Merged" with the master, and so, code 
          can be developed without any risk of corrupting or ruining the Master. A branch can 
          be rolled back, discontinued, and/or be discarded if necessary. If however a branch is 
          considered ok, it can be merged with the master, and so be included/merged into the 
          final version of the project. 



Some actions


“Commit”: Update local repository.

“Push”:  Update remote repository with updates from local repository (in this case, the Github 	  	   repository).

“Fetch”: Only downloads new data from a remote repository - but it doesn't integrate any of this 	   new data into your working files. Fetch is great for getting a fresh view on all the things 	   that happened in a remote repository. Due to it's "harmless" nature, you can rest assured: 	   fetch will never manipulate, destroy, or screw up anything.

“Pull”: Updates your current HEAD branch with the latest changes from the remote server. This 	means that pull not only downloads new data; it also directly integrates it into your current 	working copy files.
