Git terminology

"Master": Source code, that is considered to be the final version of the project. 
          The Master can not be rolled back to a previous state.
        
"Branch": Source code, that is not considered to be the final version (code under development). 
          A branch does not effect the Master until it is "Merged" with the master, and so, code 
          can be developed without any risk of corrupting or ruining the Master. A branch can 
          be rolled back, discontinued, and/or be discarded if necessary. If however a branch is 
          considered ok, it can be merged with the master, and so be included/merged into the 
          final version of the project.
